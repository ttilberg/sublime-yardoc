## SublimeText package for generating Yardoc

This is a fork of the original [sublime-yardoc](https://github.com/revathskumar/sublime-yardoc) with some my improvements.

---

### Installation

- In Command Palette (ctrl+shift+p or cmd+shift+p) select: `Package Control: Add Repository`
  - Add this project's GitHub URL: https://github.com/phts/sublime-yardoc

- In the Command Palette, select: `Package Control: Install Package`
  - Search for `sublime-yardoc` and ensure the source references this repository
  
### With Package Control
The easiest way to install this is with [Package Control](http://wbond.net/sublime\_packages/package\_control).

   * If you just went and installed Package Control, you probably need to restart Sublime Text 2    before doing this next bit.
   * Bring up the Command Palette (Command+Shift+p on OS X, Control+Shift+p on Linux/Windows).
   * Select "Package Control: Install Package" (it'll take a few seconds)
   * Select Yardoc when the list appears.

Package Control will automatically keep Yardoc up to date with the latest version.

### Without Package Control

Go to your Sublime Text 2 **Packages** directory and clone the repository using the command below:

    git clone git@github.com:revathskumar/sublime-yardoc.git yardoc

Don't forget to keep updating it, though!

### Usage
